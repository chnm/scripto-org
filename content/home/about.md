Scripto opens up the possibilities of community-sourced transcription, translation, or description for digital humanities projects in universities, libraries, archives, and museums. With easy-to-implement extensions for the Omeka Classic and Omeka S, Scripto allows administrators for any project to now enlist a community of enthusiasts to participate in this aspect of cultural heritage work.

### What is Scripto?

Scripto is an open-source tool that permits registered users to view digital files and transcribe them with an easy-to-use toolbar, rendering that text searchable. The tool includes a versioning history and editorial controls to make public contributions more manageable, and supports the transcription of a wide range of file types (both images and documents).

There are two versions of Scripto, each of which works with a different version of Omeka. Scripto for Omeka Classic creates a single transcription project for the content of your Omeka Classic site. Scripto for Omeka S enables the creation of multiple projects built from shared items in your Omeka S installation.

### Project History

Developed at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, the original Scripto project was supported by a Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant from the the National Endowment for the Humanities, and by the National Archives and Records Administrationâ€™s National Historical Publications and Records Commission. 

Scripto for Omeka S was made possible by a Digital Humanities Advancement Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2017.
